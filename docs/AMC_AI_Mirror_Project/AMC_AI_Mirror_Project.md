## AMC AI Mirror Project

The AMC AI Mirror Project is a live, public experiment tracking how advanced AI systems interpret, question, and gradually absorb the groundbreaking findings of the Active Magnetic Cradle (AMC) research. 
By posing identical, structured questions to various AI models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude), we capture a timeline of evolving comprehension — from initial classical assumptions to deeper ontological insights. 
Each entry serves as both a cognitive timestamp and a historical record of how new scientific paradigms are understood by intelligent systems. 
Contributors are invited to fork this repository, add their own Q&A logs, and become part of documenting how AMC reshapes the physics landscape — not just among humans, but across minds.
