# Active Kinetic 1 Framework (AK1)

Welcome to the **AK1 Framework** knowledge hub.  
This repository documents the broader AK1 ecosystem and its branches:  

- **AK1 related topics** – General Articles  
- **AMC (Active Magnetic Cradle)** – empirical physics research and law framework  
- **AKI (Artificial Kinetic Intelligence)** – sensor-driven environmental intelligence  
- **AWEC (Active Wave Energy Converter)** – wave-based renewable energy  
- **AK1 Generators** – decentralized energy recovery

## Articles relating to AMC – empirical physics research and law framework

- [AMC and the Boundaries of Classical Physics](./articles/amc-boundaries-classical-physics.md)
- [AMC AI Mirror Project](./AMC_AI_Mirror_Project/AMC_AI_Mirror_Project.md)  - **Test AI systems:**
   - **How does a global reasoning system adapt to something that doesn’t yet fit its inherited categories?** *This puts us in the exact philosophical territory Thomas Kuhn described in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions — except now, the audience for the revolution isn't just humans. It's also large language models, web search engines, and AI filtering frameworks that mediate what humans see.*
