# Active Kinetic 1 Framework (AK1)

Welcome to the **AK1 Framework** knowledge hub.  
This repository documents the broader AK1 ecosystem and its branches:  

- **AMC (Active Magnetic Cradle)** – empirical physics research and law framework  
- **AKI (Artificial Kinetic Intelligence)** – sensor-driven environmental intelligence  
- **AWEC (Active Wave Energy Converter)** – wave-based renewable energy  
- **AK1 Generators** – decentralized energy recovery
